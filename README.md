## 📖 Introduction & Philosophy

**PixelMusic** is an open-source third-party hybrid Android music client designed to bring local playback, user-authorized streaming sources, Telegram audio access, personal cloud libraries, and AI-assisted playlist creation into one polished experience.

PixelMusic supports local offline library indexing, high-resolution local file playback, synchronized lyrics, advanced audio controls, and optional third-party integrations. You can scan and play local files such as FLAC, ALAC, WAV, and MP3. You can also connect supported personal accounts or sources where authorized.

YouTube Music-related functionality is unofficial and intended only for personal use with content the user is authorized to access, subject to applicable laws and platform terms.

Beautifully styled with a state-of-the-art UI/UX, the interface adapts dynamically to the colors of your album artwork. The app includes synchronized LRC lyrics with manual timing offset adjustment, a professional 10-band equalizer, Chromecast support, Android Auto support, and a Wear OS companion experience.

## 🎨 UI/UX Excellence: Based on PixelPlayerOSS

PixelMusic's high-fidelity interface is built upon the GPL-3.0-licensed foundation of **[PixelPlayerOSS](https://github.com/PixelPlayerHQ/PixelPlayerOSS)**.

> [!NOTE]
> Credit and gratitude to **[PixelPlayerOSS](https://github.com/PixelPlayerHQ/PixelPlayerOSS)**, crafted by **Theo Vilardo** and **Duhan Yağmur Delikkulak**, for its original Android UI/UX foundation.

Key UI/UX visual paradigms adopted from PixelPlayerOSS include:

* **Dynamic Material You Theming:** High-precision HSL color extraction from album artwork that smoothly updates the player, bottom sheets, sliders, and navigation bar to match the mood of the current track.
* **Fluid Micro-Animations:** Seamless screen transitions, predictive back-swipe handling, physics-based scroll bars, and springy gesture-driven mini-players.
* **Premium Expressive Sliders:** Custom smooth-corner sliders and elegant volume control sheets that respond naturally to user touch.
* **State-of-the-Art Widgets:** Material 3 Glance home-screen widgets providing deep in-context customization and interactive controls directly from your launcher.
